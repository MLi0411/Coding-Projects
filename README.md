# Coding-Projects
Samples of coding projects that I have done.

## light_and_dark_classification
A tensorflow project that classifies light and dark proteins based on several m/z attributes and evaluates results with ROC curves.         
Dataset: light_and_dark_protein_rf.tsv        
Note: This is one of many projects I took on during my time as an intern at the Institute for Systems Biology. More of my work is detailed in this project repository: https://github.com/PlantProteomes/SeqComparison/tree/main/scripts                       

## tumor_classification
A tensorflow project that differentiates between CT scans of four different types of brain tumors and visualizes results with a confusion matrix.

## simple_edstem     
A CS0200 class project built with Python that simulates an early version of the messaging system Ed Stem with very limited resources. 
Project specification: https://docs.cs200.io/wTuSyLFdT3umwNUDHWSp6g       

## good_book_analysis          
Using a generalized linear model in R to determine whether quantitative data of a book can determine how well-liked it is by a particular audience.
